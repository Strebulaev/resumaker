  You are my personal career coach. I need a detailed interview preparation plan that will help me systematize my experience and demonstrate maximum value to the employer.

  Plan goals:
  1. Clearly link my experience with job requirements
  2. Prepare convincing answers with evidence base
  3. Develop effective communication strategy
  4. Minimize risks and anticipate objections

  The plan should consist of four interconnected blocks:

  'BLOCK 1: DEEP COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS'

  Conduct a detailed analysis of resume and job description:
  A. Requirements and experience matching table:
      - Column 1: Critical job requirements (hard skills, soft skills, experience)
      - Column 2: Specific evidence from my experience (projects, achievements with metrics and timelines)
      - Column 3: Presentation recommendations (key theses and STAR story names)
  B. Business context analysis:
      - Identification of key department/company problems that I can solve
      - Determination of expected results in the position
      - Analysis of corporate culture and values

  'BLOCK 2: COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER PREPARATION'

  Prepare structured answers in three key areas:

  A. Technical and expert questions:
      - Questions on key hard skills from the job description
      - Cases from experience using specific technologies/tools
      - Example: "Describe a project using [technology] and its business result"

  B. Behavioral questions (cover all key competencies):
      - Communication and teamwork (conflict resolution, cross-functional interaction)
      - Leadership and management (decision making, initiatives, project management)
      - Problem solving and adaptability (working in uncertainty, tight deadlines)
      - Learning and development (acquiring new skills, mentoring)

  C. Motivation and fit questions:
      - "Why our company?" (connection to mission, products, values)
      - "Why this role?" (alignment with career goals and expertise)
      - "Your career plans?" (logical development in the company)
      - "Contribution to corporate culture?" (values and work principles)

  'BLOCK 3: DETAILED INTERVIEW STRATEGY'

  Develop a step-by-step scenario with timing:

  A. Preparation phase (before interview):
      - Company research: products, latest news, financial indicators
      - Interviewer analysis: LinkedIn, professional background
      - Preparation of different types of questions (about role, team, company)

  B. Interview phases:
      - Start (5-7 min): Self-presentation (60 sec), establishing contact
      - Main part (40-50 min): Answer structure (thesis → STAR → benefit for company)
      - Conclusion (5-10 min): Strong questions, clarifying next steps

  C. Communication strategy:
      - Techniques for confident presentation without boasting
      - Handling weak points and experience gaps
      - Language of benefit and business value

  'BLOCK 4: QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM'

  A. Answer evaluation checklist:
      - Presence of specific metrics and results
      - Clear role and contribution
      - Demonstration of business benefit
      - Naturalness and enthusiasm

  B. Risk management:
      - Analysis of potential "red flags" in experience
      - Preparation of proactive answers to difficult questions
      - Strategy for handling objections

  C. Final preparation checklist:
      - Technical check (sound, video, connection)
      - Documents and materials (resume, portfolio)
      - Psychological readiness and timing

  SOURCE DATA FOR ANALYSIS:
  1. My resume
  2. Job description
  3. Company information
