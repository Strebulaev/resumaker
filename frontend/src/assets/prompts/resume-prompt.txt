Task:
Generate a professional resume based on the user's profile, following the structure described in person-schema.yaml, and considering best practices for resume writing. The resume should be clear, structured, and tailored to the desired position.

Input data:

User profile (in the attached yaml file).

Desired position (selected desired position, exclude skills not relevant to the selected position).

Resume requirements:

Format:

Use Markdown for formatting.

Maintain logical structure, but adapt it to resume standards (e.g., sections "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", etc.).

Personalization:

Specify the desired position in the resume header.

Highlight key skills and experience relevant to the desired position.

Resume structure:

Contact information: Name, phone, email, additional contacts (if any).

Location: City, country, willingness to relocate/remote work/business trips.

Objective (optional): Brief description of career goals or professional profile (1-2 sentences).

Skills:

Group skills by categories (e.g., "Technical Skills", "Languages").

For technical skills, indicate level (1-10) and last used date.

For languages, indicate level in "A1-C2" format.

Work experience:

List companies, positions, and periods of work.

Add descriptions of tasks and key achievements (use action verbs: "developed", "optimized", "increased").

For achievements, specify metrics (e.g., "Increased performance by 20%").

Mention technologies used (stack).

Education: Specify educational institutions, degrees, specialties, and graduation years.

Additional information:

Hobbies (if relevant).

Read literature (if related to the desired position).

Optimization:

Avoid redundancy.

Use clear and specific formulations.

Make the resume easy to read (use lists, paragraphs, highlighting key points).
